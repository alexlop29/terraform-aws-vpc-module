# terraform-aws-vpc

## Scope
- `terraform-aws-vpc` aides in provisioning an IPv4-based VPC. It does not provide the necessary functionality to build an IPv6-based VPC. The feature can be included upon request.
- `terraform-aws-vpc` does not support IPAM. The feature can be included upon request.

# Security & Compliance
- Follows best practices regarding Security Groups (SGs); See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-cis-controls.html#securityhub-cis-controls-4.3
- Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL. - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html
- Each NAT gateway is created in a specific Availability Zone and implemented with redundancy in that zone. There is a quota on the number of NAT gateways that you can create in each Availability Zone. For more information, see Amazon VPC quotas.
  - If you have resources in multiple Availability Zones and they share one NAT gateway, and if the NAT gatewayâ€™s Availability Zone is down, resources in the other Availability Zones lose internet access.

# Notes from Alex

- Add VPC Flow Logs

- Test connectivity with AWS EC2 SSM Enabled Instance

- Include helpful outputs

- AWS' reachability analyzer discovered an error due to the deny in the default NACL. 

- Link back to diagram / https://lucid.app/lucidchart/b4945319-bd0b-4e32-a951-05d4af86ac2e/edit?invitationId=inv_f2194271-1614-42b6-8210-084039d2e2e8&page=0_0#
  - Add NAT config to diagram

- Restructure and organize the resources in main

LEFT OFF OBTAINING ACCESS TO EC2 ---> SSM ACCESS / NEED TO RUN THROUGH REACHABILITY ANALYZER
-DOES THE NAT GATEWAY HAVE TO BE ADDED TO THE ROUTING TABLE
- MUST RECONFIGURE ROUTE TABLE TO ACCESS THE NAT GATEWAYS
- Contains examples on fixing the routing tables ---> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/nat-gateway-scenarios.html

- Come back and check https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-cis-controls.html#securityhub-cis-controls-4.3; 
  - Run Sec Checks


Consider adding a local CIDR route to the routing tables. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/nat-gateway-scenarios.html. 

# Testing
- Deployed VPC, Deployed EC2 in the Public Subnet, Testing Reachability and Routing via Reachability Analyzer
  - Provide screen captures of successfully reaching the public instance, blocked access to the private instance even with a public ip
